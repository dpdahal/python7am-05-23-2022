# Arithmetic Operators: +,-, *, /, %, //, **
# + Addition
# - Subtraction
# * Multiplication
# / Division
# % Modulus
# ** Exponentiation
# // Floor Division

# print(19//5)

# Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=
# = Assignment
# += Addition Assignment
# -= Subtraction Assignment
# *= Multiplication Assignment
# /= Division Assignment
# %= Modulus Assignment
# //= Floor Division Assignment
# **= Exponentiation Assignment
# x = 20
# x += 50
# print(x)

# Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# == Equal
# != Not Equal
# > Greater Than
# < Less Than
# >= Greater Than or Equal
# <= Less Than or Equal

# Logical Operators: and, or, not
# and Logical AND
# or Logical OR
# not Logical NOT

# Membership Operators: in, not in
# in Checks if a value is in a sequence
# not in Checks if a value is not in a sequence
# name = 'ram'
# print('a' in name)
# print('b' not in name)

# Identity Operators: is, is not
# a = 20
# b = 50
# c = a
# print(a is b)
# print(a is c)
# print(a is not b)
# print(a is not c)


# Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>
# example:
# a = 60  # 60 = 0011 1100
# b = 13  # 13 = 0000 1101

# Compound Assignment Operators: +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=

# a, *b = 20, 50, 78, 98
# print(a)
# print(b)
